# Data Warehouse Project ðŸš€

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse Project** repository!  
This is my first hands-on project in data management, based on this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GVqKuTVANE&list=PLNcg_FV9n7qaUWeyUkPfiVtMbKlrfMqA8).

This project demonstrates a full data warehousing and analytics pipeline â€” from building the data warehouse to delivering actionable insights. It serves as a portfolio piece, reflecting industry-standard practices in **data engineering** and **analytics**.
