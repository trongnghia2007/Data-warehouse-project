# Data Warehouse Project 🚀

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse Project** repository!  
This is my first hands-on project in data management, following with this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GVqKuTVANE&list=PLNcg_FV9n7qaUWeyUkPfiVtMbKlrfMqA8).

This project demonstrates a full data warehousing and analytics pipeline — from building the data warehouse to delivering actionable insights. It serves as a portfolio piece, reflecting industry-standard practices in **data engineering** and **analytics**. You can see the particular tasks of the project on [Notion](https://axiomatic-hydrant-67a.notion.site/SQL-Data-Warehouse-Project-21301f2e86d480f39cf5f223d61d313e) here.
